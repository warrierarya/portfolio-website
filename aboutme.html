        <h1>ABOUT ME </h1>
    </div>
    <div class="p1">
        <p>I am Arya,a first-year B.Tech student pursuing engineering with a strong interest in web development and
            programming. My journey began with a fascination for how websites and applications are created, leading me
            to dive into languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from the outset. I am currently exploring Python for
            backend development, eager to understand how it integrates with front-end technologies to create cohesive
            web experiences.

        </p>
        <div class="p2">
            <p>
                Frameworks such as React have caught my attention for their versatility in building interactive user
                interfaces, and I am keen to deepen my knowledge in this area. I am also exploring database management
                systems like MySQL and learning to use Git for version control, understanding their importance in
                collaborative software development.


            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="p3">
            <p>While I am in the early stages of my academic career, I am already applying my knowledge through
                small-scale projects and exercises, such as creating personal websites and simple web applications.
                These experiences have not only reinforced my understanding of fundamental concepts but have also
                sparked my interest in pursuing more complex challenges.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="p4">
            <p>Beyond academics, I am proactive in seeking opportunities to gain practical experience. I am exploring
                internship possibilities that will allow me to further develop my skills and contribute to real-world
                projects. Additionally, I am open to freelance opportunities where I can apply my growing expertise in
                web development and programming.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="p5">
            <p>
                Looking ahead, my goal is to build a solid foundation in web development throughout my B.Tech journey. I
                am enthusiastic about the prospect of expanding my skills in creating responsive and user-friendly
                websites, leveraging new technologies, and contributing meaningfully to innovative projects in the tech
                industry upon graduation.
